# 3loa
Does your API require 3-leg authentication? Well with the help of a small helper container you can achieve automation of 3-leg using the API Fortress platform. Thanks to the helper, your local machine can help in the automation of your tests logging in using 3-leg auths such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google.

First let's deploy the helper container, once you have the 3loa folder downloaded, navigate to that folder within a terminal window. Then run the following command to start the 3loa container:"sudo docker-compose up -d"

The 3-leg helper is now live and can be access from API Fortress using the following URL:"http://3loa.apifortress:3000/oauth"
